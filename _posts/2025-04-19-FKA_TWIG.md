The Eleven (EUSEXUA) is a bold and enigmatic project from FKA twigs, diving deep into the space between vulnerability and power.

More than just an album, it's an experience—blending avant-garde sound design, haunting vocals, and immersive storytelling that pushes the boundaries of genre and form. With each track, twigs crafts a world that feels both intensely personal and otherworldly, inviting listeners to lose themselves in the folds of her imagination. EUSEXUA is performance, poetry, and emotion wrapped in sonic experimentation—delivered as only twigs can.
